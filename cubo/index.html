        Design Outcome
      </h2>
      <p>
       I transform a vast amount of sleep data to the no-brainer - easily digestible information, 
      <span class="research-question">a dashboard that parents can take a glance at and assess their baby's sleep status with real numbers.</span></p>
      <p>From user interviews and questionnaires, parents consider total hours of sleep an essential indicator of their baby's sleep quality. Users can quickly tell if it's a good or bad night with the enlarged section. Other numbers, Longest sleep, Time to fall asleep, are helpful for parents who adopt sleep training methods.</p>
      <p>Caregivers consider longer sleep stretch as an important indicator. In our design, they can tell from the visualization of Zz to tell if the sleep was consistent. Also, cry üò≠ and movement üëã were considered #1 and #2 priorities representing interrupted sleep.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="1_sleep_analytics.gif" alt="sleep analytics dashboard" class="imgif">
      </figure>
      <p>From the user interviews and former feature requests gathered by Customer Support Team, one of the most frequent request is fast-forward and video scrubbing because caregivers want to make sure it was a good night and if not, they would check what went wrong during the night so they can iterate their nursery arrangement and sleeping schedule. <span class="research-question">I therefore extended this caregiver's habit of checking the stored video from the last 18 hours and added a "event tag" design.</span> A caregiver always wants to review & improve, so when they scroll through last night's video timeline, the highlights become easy-to-access and they can easily understand the consequences of each sleep event.</p>
